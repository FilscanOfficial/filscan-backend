    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data is first imported to a local node to generate a CID, then a storage deal is initiated. The data is split, encoded, and replicated before being sealed into sectors. Miners perform pre-commit, sealing, and commit operations to secure the data and periodically submit proof-of-storage. When retrieval is needed, users access the decoded data from miners using the CID.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/morph1max/portraits-rgba-png?resource=download",
