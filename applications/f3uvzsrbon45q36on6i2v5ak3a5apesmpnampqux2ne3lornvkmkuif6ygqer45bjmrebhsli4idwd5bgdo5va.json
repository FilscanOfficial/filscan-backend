    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We regularly back up AI datasets, historical events in video, and the large volume of log files generated during AI computations from our servers. This data is stored on a separate server and packaged into CAR files with corresponding CIDs, which are made available for storage providers (SPs) to download and use. Concurrently, we require SPs to submit a file list upon completion of sealing, clearly specifying the mapping to sectors on the Filecoin chain. When necessary, we will request SPs to restore data according to our requirements to ensure data integrity and availability.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://cvmart.net/course/detail/13",
