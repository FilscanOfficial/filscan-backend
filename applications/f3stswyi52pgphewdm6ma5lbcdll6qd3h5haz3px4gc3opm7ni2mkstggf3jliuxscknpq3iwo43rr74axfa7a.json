    "Brief history of your project and organization": "ActivityNet, a large-scale video dataset to help improve how AI understands human actions in real-world videos. It includes thousands of untrimmed YouTube videos labeled with over 200 everyday activities. Since 2016, it has hosted the annual ActivityNet Challenge at top AI conferences like CVPR, encouraging research in action recognition, temporal localization, and video captioning. The project has become a key benchmark in video understanding research.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Dataset include video files and associated annotation data, forming a benchmark designed for evaluating action recognition algorithms in untrimmed, real-world video settings. This dataset plays a key role in supporting machine learning research and development in areas such as computer vision, video understanding, and autonomous systems.\n\nContent:\n1. High-resolution untrimmed YouTube videos capturing a wide range of human activities in natural environments. (Approximate 800 TIB)\n2. Temporal annotations that mark the start and end times of over 200 different human actions across thousands of videos. (Approximate 400 TIB)\n3. Metadata detailing class labels, training/testing splits, and contextual information. (Approximate 500 TIB)\n4. Derived data such as dense captions, motion features, and evaluation results from past ActivityNet Challenges. (Approximate 300 TiB)\n\nEach storage provider (SP) will store approximately 2 PIB, resulting in a total storage need of 10 PIB.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data is first uploaded and assigned a unique Content Identifier (CID). It is then divided into smaller parts, encoded, and replicated multiple times to ensure durability. These pieces are sealed into storage sectors. Storage providers handle the full storage process—including pre-commit, sealing, and final commit—and regularly submit cryptographic proofs to confirm that the data remains secure and unchanged. The CID can be used at any time to locate, reconstruct, and retrieve the original data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "http://activity-net.org/download.html",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Greater China, Europe, South America, North America, Africa",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, I don't know yet, Venus built-in data transfer, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1. f03519247 Russia\n2. f03543055 Russia\n3. f03551138 US\n4. f03590163 Korea\n5. f03605957 Hongkong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
