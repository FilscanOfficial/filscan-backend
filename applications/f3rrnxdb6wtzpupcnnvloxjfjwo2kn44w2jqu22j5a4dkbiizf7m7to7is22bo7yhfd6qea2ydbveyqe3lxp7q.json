    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Meteorological Satellite Center, established to advance weather forecasting, began operating the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) series, starting with \"Himawari\" in 1978. It progressed to launching the advanced Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 satellites in 2014 and 2016, respectively, enhancing weather and environmental monitoring across the Asia-Pacific. The MSC introduced data services like HimawariCast and HimawariCloud in 2015 for efficient data dissemination to meteorological services, supports global weather prediction and disaster mitigation.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Meteorological Satellite Center stores Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 satellite data. This includes high-resolution, multi-spectral imagery captured, covering weather patterns, typhoons, and environmental phenomena in the Asia-Pacific region. The data, available at various spatial resolutions, supports meteorological forecasting and disaster monitoring.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "As a data preparer, we would start by dividing the Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 satellite imagery into smaller, efficient segments for storage. Each segment is encrypted to ensure security and distributed across multiple nodes for redundancy and reliability. The data is uploaded to the network, receiving a unique Content Identifier (CID) for tracking purposes. The process, managed end-to-end, includes preparation, encryption, storage, and verification, with cryptographic proofs generated to validate data integrity, allowing seamless retrieval and decryption using the CID when needed.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-himawari/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Australia (continent), Asia other than Greater China, Greater China, North America, South America, Europe, Africa",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Lotus built-in data transfer, Venus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1.f02003699 Russia\n2.f02002666 Hongkong, China\n3.f02002555 California, USA\n4.f02002333 Seoul, South Korea\n5.f02002200 Changsha，China\n6.f03519247 Russia\n7.f03543055 Russia\n8.f03551138 US\n9.f03590163 Korea\n10.f03605957 Hongkong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
