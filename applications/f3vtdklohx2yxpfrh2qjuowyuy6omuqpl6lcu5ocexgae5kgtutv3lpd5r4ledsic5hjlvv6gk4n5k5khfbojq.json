    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Magenta is an open-source project that originated from the Brain team in 2016, aimed at exploring the role of machine learning in the creative process, particularly in music and art. Built on TensorFlow, Magenta develops models and tools that allow artists and musicians to collaborate with AI in generating melodies, harmonies, images, and more. While the project started research division, it has since grown into a broader open-source community effort, enabling developers and creatives around the world to experiment with and contribute to the evolving intersection of technology and creativity.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data to be stored on Filecoin includes a collection of open-source machine learning models, training datasets, pre-trained checkpoints, and creative artifacts such as AI-generated music tracks, MIDI files, and notebooks that demonstrate the use of generative models. These resources used by artists, researchers, and developers, are part of Magenta’s toolkit for music and art creation with machine learning.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "To store the data, it is first imported and assigned a unique Content Identifier (CID). The data is then broken into segments, encoded, and replicated to ensure durability, and sealed into storage sectors. Storage providers manage the process by handling pre-commitment, sealing, and final commitment stages, and they regularly submit cryptographic proofs to confirm the data’s continued integrity. The CID can later be used to locate, decode, and retrieve the original content.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/bach-doodle#download",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Greater China, Europe, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Lotus built-in data transfer, HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, I don't know yet",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1. f03540552 Los Angeles, US\n2. f03540038 Moscow, Rusia\n3. f03538789 Ha Batrung, Vitan\n4. f03519246 Shenzhen, China\n5. f03519341 HK,China",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
