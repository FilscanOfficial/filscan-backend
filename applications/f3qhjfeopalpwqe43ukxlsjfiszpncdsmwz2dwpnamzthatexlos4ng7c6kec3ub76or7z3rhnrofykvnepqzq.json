    "Brief history of your project and organization": "OpenNeuro started in 2011 to help researchers share brain imaging data and support reproducible science. In 2018, expanding to include more types of brain scans like MRI, EEG, and MEG. It uses a standard format called BIDS to make data easy to share and reuse. Today, OpenNeuro hosts hundreds of datasets and is supported by major research groups like the NIH, helping scientists around the world work together more openly and effectively.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "OpenNeuro stores over 600 neuroimaging datasets, primarily MRI data (like fMRI, structural, and diffusion MRI). These datasets, include over 500 terabytes from sources like OpenNeuro, ABIDE, and NeuroVault.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "The data is first split into smaller segments, secured through encryption, and distributed across multiple storage nodes to ensure dependability. Prior to this, the data must be uploaded and assigned a unique Content Identifier (CID) for tracking purposes. The storage system oversees all stages of the process, including initial setup, data locking, and final validation, while consistently producing cryptographic proofs to verify data integrity. With the CID, the original data can be effortlessly retrieved, decrypted, and accessed when required.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://openneuro.org/ ",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Africa, North America, Europe, South America, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Venus built-in data transfer, Lotus built-in data transfer, I don't know yet",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1.f03541949 US\n2.f03550179 Philippines\n3.f03561606 Hongkong\n4.f03604522 Vietnam\n5.f03614364 Philippines\n6.f03540040 US\n7.f03545863 Philippines\n8.f03557685 Singapore\n9.f03602381 Vietnam\n10.f03612782 Philippines",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
