    "Brief history of your project and organization": "VinDr, created by VinBigData, is an AI-powered medical imaging solution. Launched to advance diagnostics, it offers large-scale datasets like VinDr-CXR, VinDr-Mammo, and others, collected from Vietnamese hospitals (2018–2020). These open datasets, with detailed annotations, support AI research. VinDr Lab, an open-source platform, aids collaborative medical data annotation.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Data stored includes:\n\n- High-resolution medical images: Chest X-rays (VinDr-CXR: 18,000+ scans), mammograms (VinDr-Mammo: 5,000 exams), pediatric CXRs, spine X-rays, and more. (~ 600 TiB)\n- Annotations: Radiologist labels for findings, lesions, and segmentations. (~500 TiB)\n- Metadata: Training/testing splits and clinical context for AI research. (~300 TiB)\n- Derived data: AI model outputs and benchmarks from VinDr Lab. (~400 TiB)\n\nTotal storage: ~1.8 PiB, supporting medical AI research.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Here’s a simplified explanation of how data is prepared:\n\nThe data is first uploaded and assigned a unique Content Identifier (CID) for tracking. It is then divided into smaller chunks, encoded for security, and replicated across multiple storage nodes to ensure reliability. The storage system manages the entire process, including pre-commit, sealing, and final commit stages, while regularly generating cryptographic proofs to confirm data integrity. Using the CID, the original data can be easily located, decoded, and retrieved when needed.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://vindr.ai/datasets/cxr\nhttps://vindr.ai/datasets/spinexr\nhttps://vindr.ai/datasets/ribcxr",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Greater China, Africa, North America, South America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "I don't know yet, Venus built-in data transfer, Lotus built-in data transfer, IPFS",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1.f03519270 Hongkong, China\n2.f03519265 Seoul, South Korea\n3.f03519255 Shenzhen, China\n4.f03519250 Los Angeles, US\n5.f02003699 Russia",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
